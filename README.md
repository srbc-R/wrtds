Contains all R Scripts which SRBC scientists have developed for the WRTDS water quality model

# Background
The SRBC collects water samples as part of its its Sediment and Nutrient Assessment Program (SNAP). The SNAP network currently consists of 26 sites monitored for various nitrogen and phosphorus species and suspended sediment. Data are used to quantify the amount of nitrogen, phosphorus, and suspended sediment transported at each site and to calculate trends in loads and concentrations.

Concentrations, loads (i.e. fluxes), and yields and their respective trends over time are calculated using the Weighted Regression on Time, Discharge, and Season (WRTDS) statistical method developed by scientists at the USGS. **1**

Furthermore, the WRTDS analysis relies on USGS R packages dataRetrieval, EGRET, and EGRETci, found on github.
